			<p>Working in tech has always been a dream of mine (prior to that it was being a pastry chef). I enjoy the creativity and problem-solving skills involved in software engineering. I love how I'm constantly learning new technologies and
				debugging pesky bugs.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I graduated from University of California, Riverside where I studied Sociology and Computer Science. I was involved with ACM (Association of Computer Machinery) and SWE (Society of Women Engineers). In college, I spent a lot of time
				leading outreach events and volunteering with STEM-centric organizations like Girls Who Code.</p>
			<br>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy going on runs and rooting for my favorite NBA players. When I can, I enjoy baking desserts or reading non-fiction.</p>
